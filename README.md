#Star Wars vs. Cartoons: Tower Defense Mobile App

A project for this group's class: CSE2102 - Introduction to Software Engineering.

###Our Goal

Our goal with this project is to create a tower defense game with an unique theme! It's based on the classic Tower Defense style game (like [Bloons Tower Defense 5](http://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Play/Bloons-Tower-Defense-5.html)). Given the name of the title our themes are to incorporate Star Wars with pop-culture cartoons (i.e. 
The Simpsons, Family Guy, etc.)

This game is purely for fun, and given probable licencing conflicts, only exists for the purposes of this group's CSE-2102 class. We make no claims 
to any of the fictious characters referenced herein. 

###Contents

Included thus far in the project are three things. 

1. A Sample Objective-C Game. 
	The source code for this game was taken from [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/37701/how-to-make-a-tower-defense-game-tutorial). We will not be using this code, but it serves as a good model for the remainder of our project. 

2. An outline (in Java) of our Classes.
	This is a generic idea of what classes we will need to serve the core game logic of our project. 

3. An xCode project.
	This is our folder for our ongoing development in xCode using SpriteKit.
