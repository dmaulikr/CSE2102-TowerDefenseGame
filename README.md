#Star Wars vs. Cartoons: Reverse Tower Defense Mobile App

A project for this group's class: CSE2102 - Introduction to Software Engineering.

##Our Goal

Our goal with this project is to create a tower defense game; but in reverse. You are the critters trying to get to the end, and are 
trying to avoid the towers shooting at you. Given the name of the title our themes are to incorporate Star Wars with pop-culture cartoons (i.e. 
The Simpsons, Family Guy, etc.)

This game is purely for fun, and given probable licencing conflicts, only exists for the purposes of this group's CSE-2102 class. We make no claims 
to any of the fictious characters referenced herein. 

##Contents

Included thus far in the project are three things. 

1. A Sample Objective-C Game. 
	The source code for this game was taken from [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/37701/how-to-make-a-tower-defense-game-tutorial) We will not be using this code, but it serves as a good model for the remainder of our project. 

2. An outline (in Java) of our Classes
	This is a generic idea of what classes we will need to serve the core game logic of our project. 

3. An empty AndroidStudio project
	This may change to xCode given the sample obj-c game, thinking that it will be easier and more efficient to code in xCode rather than Android Studio.
