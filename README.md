#H1 Star Wars vs. Cartoons: Reverse Tower Defense Mobile App

Included thus far in the project are three things. 

1. A Sample Objective-C Game. 
...The source code for this game was taken from [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/37701/how-to-make-a-tower-defense-game-tutorial)..
...We will not be using this code, but it serves as a good model for the remainder of our project. 

2. An outline (in Java) of our Classes
...This is a generic idea of what classes we will need to serve the core game logic of our project. 

3. An empty AndroidStudio project
...This may change to xCode given the sample obj-c game, thinking that it will be easier and more efficient to code in xCode rather than Android Studio.
